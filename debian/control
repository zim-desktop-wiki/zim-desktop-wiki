Description: Desktop Wiki Editor
 Zim is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wiki pages.
 Each page can contain links to other pages, simple formatting and images.
 Pages are stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and can have
 attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a nonexistent page.
 All data is stored in plain text files with wiki formatting. Various plugins
 provide additional functionality, like a task list manager, an equation editor,
 a tray icon, and support for version control.
 .
 Zim can be used to:
  * Keep an archive of notes
  * Keep a daily or weekly journal
  * Take notes during meetings or lectures
  * Organize task lists
  * Draft blog entries and emails
  * Do brainstorming
