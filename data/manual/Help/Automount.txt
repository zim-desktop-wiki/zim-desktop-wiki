====== Automount ======

As a special feature notebooks can be "mounted" automatically when opened. This can e.g. be used to connect with remote drives or unlock an encrypted drive when zim is trying to open a specific notebook.

===== Config file =====
The paths to be automounted and the commands to mount them are configured in a config file "''~/.config/zim/automount.conf''" (see [[Config Files]] for alternative locations).

The config file has a group for each path, followed by options. Currently, the only supported option is a "mount" command. For example, if you have an Ubuntu setup to encrypt the "''~/Documents''" folder, you can create a config file with the following two lines:

'''
[Path ~/Documents]
mount=xterm -e /usr/bin/ecryptfs-mount-private
'''

The result will be that whenever zim tries to access a notebook stored under the Documents folder while that folder is not decrypted, it will prompt a terminal window to ask for the password and then mount the folder. If it fails, you still get a "notebook not found" error.

Similarly, you can configure various scripts of your own design.
