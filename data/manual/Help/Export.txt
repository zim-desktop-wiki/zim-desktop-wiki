====== Exporting ======

Zim will be able to export content to various formats. At the moment exporting to [[Help:Export:HTML|HTML]] and [[Help:Export:LaTeX|LaTeX]] is supported, as well as the Markdown and RST text formats.

===== Export dialog =====
To open the export dialog in zim, use the "//File//->//Export//" menu item. This dialog asks for several input fields before you can start exporting.

==== Step1: Select the pages to export ====
The option **Complete Notebook** will export all pages in the current notebook.

The option **Single page** allows exporting a single page.

When the **Include subpages** option is selected all pages below the selected page will be exported as well recursively.

==== Step 2: Select the export format ====
The **Format** allows the choice of the output format.

The **Template** field asks you to select a template file (see below). When you select "''Other...''" in the combo box you can browse for another file in the input field below the combo box.

If your notebook has a Document Root (see [[Properties]])  you can select what to do with links to files under that document root. Either **Link files under document root with full file path**, which means files will be linked by their absolute file path, or **Map document root to URL**, which will result in links with the given URL as prefix. This can be useful when you [[Usage:Publishing|publish]] pages as part of a larger website.

==== Step 3: Select the output file or folder ====
Depending on the choice of pages to export and the format to export you can get to choice to either **Export each page to a separate file** or to **Export all pages to a single file**. Exporting each page to a separate file typically results in a folder with multiple files, one for each page that is exported, very similar to the zim notebook itself. Exporting to a single file creates a different view where all pages are combined in a single output template.

Here you can select the **output folder** (if you are exporting multiple pages) or the **output file** (if you export a single page).

If you specify an **Index page** a page will be generated that contains a list with links to all pages that were exported. This can e.g. be used as a site map.


===== Attachments =====
Files and images that live inside the notebook directory ([[Help:Attachments|attachments]], equations etc.) will always be copied to the new output directory when you export a notebook.

===== Templates =====
The export code only produces the tags that represent the content of the page. [[Templates]] are used to create complete output. A few standard templates are packaged  with zim, see the pages for the output formats for a list and descriptions. You can also make your own.

===== Exporting from the commandline =====
Try something like:

'''
$ zim --export --output=./html \
  --format=html --template=./foo.html ~/Notes
'''

See "''zim --help''" for all options.
