Prompt for a page name and create a new page as a child of the current page.

**Open Another Notebook <Ctrl><O>**
Prompt a list of known notebooks for opening another notebook. This dialog will also allow you to specify a file path for a new notebook.

**Import Page**
Prompts for a file path for a text file to import into this notebook. The text file is assumed to be already using the wiki formatting used by the notebook. Files saved using "Save A Copy" can be imported again by this function. The basename of the imported file will be used as the page name.

**Open in New Window**
Open the current page in a separate window. The new window will be read-only and any links clicked will open in the main window.

**Save <Ctrl><S>**
Save the current page. This function is included to not scare users that do not feel comfortable with only auto-save. However, pages are being saved continuously, save there is hardly any need to explicitly save them.

**Save A Copy**
This function is intended for saving a copy of the current page outside of the notebook as a text file using the wiki syntax of the notebook. These files can later be imported again with the "Import Page" function.

**Save Version <Shift><Ctrl><S>**
Prompt for entering a comment and save a new version. This is a snapshot of the notebook that can later be restored or used to compare changes. If no version control is enabled yet for this notebook this function will ask you to enable version control.

Only available if the [[Plugins:Version Control|Version Control plugin]] is enabled.

**Export**
Show the [[Export|export dialog]].

**Print to Browser <Ctrl><P>**
Export the current page to a temporary file and open it with the browser. This is a workaround for the lack of printing support in zim. You can print the page from the browser, so pressing <ctrl><P> twice will print the current page.

**Send To**
Open a new email with the current page as the email text using your email application.

**Rename Page**
Prompt for a new name for the current page. Optionally the page heading is also changed on the fly. Links to this page can be updated automatically.

Delete the current page and all of its child pages and [[Help:Attachments|attachments]]. Unless the current page has been stored in a saved version this can not be undone.

**Properties**
Show the [[Properties|properties dialog]].

**Quit <Ctrl><Q>**
Quit the current notebook.


===== Edit =====

**Undo <Ctrl><Z>**
Undo the last edit for the current page. The undo stack tries to be intelligent and undo edits by word or by logical action. If you start typing after an undo step the undo step itself will also be folded into the list of edits. This means you can actually undo an undo step. Pressing undo after an [[auto formatting]] triggered will first undo the automatic formatting and the next undo will undo the actual editing.
