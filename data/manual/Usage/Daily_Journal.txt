====== Daily Journal ======

You can use zim a journal notebook by using the [[Plugins:Journal|Journal plugin]].

If you want to mix journal with other notes, you can keep the journal pages in a separate section, like ':Journal'. Or you can configure the top level of the notebook as the place to keep journal pages.

For a dedicated journal notebook, you typically want to set the preference to have the calendar embedded in the side pane.
