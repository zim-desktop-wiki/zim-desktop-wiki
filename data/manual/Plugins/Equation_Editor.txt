====== Equation Editor ======

The equation editor is a simple dialog that allows you to insert equations into a page using **latex**.

In order to be able to use this plugin you must have latex installed and the following two commands must be available on your system: "''latex"'' and "''dvipng"''. You can control the look of the equations using the special template "''_Equation.tex"''. The only variable that can be used in this template is "''equation''", which will be replaced with the content from the dialog.

**Dependencies:** This plugin requires a Latex suite to be installed as well as the "dvipng" application. In specific the "latex" and "dvipng" commands should be available in the system path.

===== Syntax =====

Some quick examples of the latex math syntax. For a complete reference see the links below:

{{./equation_01.png}}


'''
c = \sqrt{ a^2 + b^2 }

\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \, dx

f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \alpha_n x^n

x_{1,2}=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{\color{Red}b^2-4ac}}{2a}

\hat a  \bar b  \vec c  x'  \dot{x}  \ddot{x}
