====== Print to Browser ======

This plugin provides a workaround for the lack of printing support in zim. It exports the current page
to HTML and opens a browser. Assuming the browser does have printing support this will get your data to the printer in two steps.

**Dependencies:** This plugin has no additional dependencies.


===== Template =====
The HTML template used is the template "Print.html". You can edit it if you want to change how a page is rendered by this plugin. To edit the template go to the "//Edit//" â†’ "//Templates//" menu item. See [[Help:Templates]] for more info on templates.
