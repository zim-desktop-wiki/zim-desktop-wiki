====== Attachment Browser ======

This plugin adds an folder view at the bottom of the main window that shows the files attached to the current page. It allows for basic operations, like dragging a file from the folder view to the page to create a link to a specific attachment.

**Dependencies:** This plugin has no additional dependencies.

===== Options =====
The option **Position in the window** determines in which side pane the browser is shown.

The option **Use thumbnails** determines whether thumbnails are used for images or not

The option **Support thumbnails for SVG** determines whether we try to thumbnail SVG images. Turning this option on can cause the application to crash on some systems due to issues with SVG support.
