====== PathBar ======
This plugin provides a "path bar" on top of the editor window that can show a list of pages. 

This list of pages can show:
* **Recent Pages:** like "history" but without doubles
* **Recently Changed Pages:** pages in order of there last modified timestamp
* **History:** the browsing history for this window
* **Page Hierarchy:** e.g. "''Projects''", "''CustomerA''" and "''MyProject''" for a page named "''Projects:CustomerA:MyProject''"

The content can be changed via the "Pathbar" sub-menu in the "View" menu.


**Dependencies:** This plugin has no additional dependencies.
