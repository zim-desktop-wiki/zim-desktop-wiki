**Dependencies:** This plugin has no additional dependencies.

===== Options =====
The option **Position in the window** determines in which side pane the browser is shown.

The option **Automatically expand sections on open page** determines whether
the section for the current page is automatically expanded.

The option **Automatically collapse sections on close page** determines whether
sections that are automatically expanded are also collapsed again on moving
away from the page. It does not affect sections that where expanded manually
by clicking on the expand arrow.
