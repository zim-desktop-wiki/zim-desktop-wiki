====== ABOUT ======

Zim - A Desktop Wiki Editor

Zim is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wiki pages.
Each page can contain links to other pages, simple formatting and images.
Pages are stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and can have
attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a nonexistent page.
All data is stored in plain text files with wiki formatting. Various plugins
provide additional functionality, like a task list manager, an equation
editor, a tray icon, and support for version control.

Zim can be used to:
* Keep an archive of notes
* Take notes during meetings or lectures
* Organize task lists
* Draft blog entries and emails
* Do brainstorming

====== INSTALLING ======

NOTE: To test zim it is not needed to install. You should be able to run it
      directly from the source directory by calling `./zim.py`. (To run a
      translated version from the source first call `./setup.py build_trans`.)


First you should verify you have the dependencies zim needs. To list all
dependencies check `./setup.py --requires`.

You will at least need the following:

	* gtk+ >= 2.6
	* python >= 2.6
	* python-gtk
	* python-gobject
	* python-xdg (optional, but recommended)
	* xdg-utils (optional, but recommended)

To verify zim is working properly on your system you can call the test suite
using `./test.py`. Failures do not have to be critical, but in principle all
tests should pass.

Zim can be installed from source using:

  ./setup.py install

Most plugins have additional requirements. These are listed in the plugin
descriptions.


===== Ubuntu =====

On Ubuntu or other debian derived systems, the following packages should be
installed:

	* python
	* libgtk2.0-0
	* python-gtk2
	* python-xdg


===== Windows =====

To install gtk, python and python-gtk on Windows see the instructions at
http://www.pygtk.org . If you use python 2.5 you will also need to install the
python simplejson module. This can be obtained from http://pypi.python.org .
The python-xdg module is not usefull on Windows, so you can skip it.

You can use the PyGTKAllInOne package to install all of the dependecies:
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi

Once the dependencies are fulfilled you can run zim directly from the source
directory.


===== Mac OS X =====

You can run zim on mac if you have the proper dependencies installed.
If you are using Mac Ports packages installing the following ports should work:

	* python26
	* py26-gtk
	* py26-simplejson
	* py26-xdg


===== Install Paths =====

If you install in a non-default location you may need to set the PYTHONPATH
environment variable in order for zim to find it's python modules.
For example, if you installed the modules below "/home/user/lib/zim" you need
to set:

	PYTHONPATH=/home/user/lib

Also zim uses the XDG paths to locate data and config files. If you get
an error that zim can not find it's data files
For example, if you installed the zim data files to "/home/user/share/zim"
you need to set the data path like this:

	XDG_DATA_DIRS=/home/user/share:/usr/local/share:/usr/share



====== PACKAGING ======

To build a tree in a target directory you can use:

	./setup.py install --root=/path/to/package/build/dir --skip-cmd

Special attention may be needed to run xdg update commands in a post-install
script. Recommended commands are:

	update-desktop-database
	update-mime-database /usr/share/mime



====== TRANSLATING ======

To contribute to translations onlne please go to http://launchpad.net.

To test a new translation you can either download the snapshot from launchpad
and run:

	./tools/import-launchpad-translations.py launchpad-export.tar.gz


Or you can edit the template zim.pot with your favourite editor. In that case
you should add you new .po file to the po/ directory.

After adding the .po file(s) you can compile the translation using:

	./setup.py build_trans
