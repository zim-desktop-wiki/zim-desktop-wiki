'''Thin wrapper for 'datetime' module from the standard library.
Provides timezone info for the local time. Based on example code
from standard library datetime documentation.

Main usage of this module is the function L{now()}. It imports all
from the standard datetime, so it can be used as a transparant
replacement.

Also adds a L{strfcal()} method and extends L{strftime()} to deal
with weeknumbers correctly.

    '''Method similar to strftime, but dealing with the weeknumber,
    day of the week and the year of that week.

    Week 1 is the first week where the Thursday is in the new year. So e.g. the
    last day of 2012 is a Monday. And therefore the calendar week for 31 Dec 2012
    is already week 1 2013.

    The locale decides whether a week starts on Monday (as the ISO standard would have
    it) or on Sunday. So depending on your locale Sun 6 Jan 2013 is either still week
    1 or already the first day of week 2.

    Codes supported by this method:

      - C{%w} is replaced by the weekday as a decimal number [1,7], with 1 representing
        either Monday or Sunday depending on the locale
      - C{%W} is replaced by the weeknumber depending on the locale
      - C{%Y} is replaced by the year with century as a decimal number, the year depends
        on the weeknumber depending on the locale
      - C{%%} is replaced by %

    Difference between this method and strftime is that:

      1. It uses locale to determine the first day of the week
      2. It returns the year that goes with the weeknumber
