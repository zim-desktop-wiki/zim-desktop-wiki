# NOTE: key design principle in this module is that we never take relative
# paths implicitely. Relative paths should always be explicit with the
# reference path being provided as an object. One reason is that this makes
# the code more robust and secure by being explicit. Secondly it allows
# test cases without touching real files, which is in general faster.

# Functions
# - (relative) pathname manipulation - specifically for links
# - file/folder info - iswritable, mtime, ctime, exists
# - file info - mimetype, size, (thumbnail)
# - file access - read, write, touch, remove (clear)
# - folder access - list, touch, remove, file, folder, child
# - tree operations - move, copy
# - signal changes (internal) - specifically for version control
# - monitor changes (external) - specifically to pick up changes in open page

# OS dependent
# - pathname should support all variants, cross platform
# - path encoding for low level functions
# - atomic rename for writing

# Classes
# - FilePath - pathname manipulation
# - File - base class for files
# - Folder - base class for folders

# local file system:
# - LocalFSObjectBase - file / folder info
# - LocalFile - file info + file access + tree operations
# - LocalFolder - folder access + tree operation

# helpers:
# - FolderMask - wraps a Folder and exposes part of children, disables all but list()
# - FSObjectMonitor - monitor single file or folder for external changes
#	- ObjectMonitorFallback - at least report internal changes
# - FSTreeMonitor - monitor internal changes, passes itself as "logger" to children

	NOTE: for consistency, this function only returns objects for existing files
	or folders, else it raises C{FileNotFoundError}
