# Functions
# - (relative) pathname manipulation - specifically for links
# - file/folder info - iswritable, mtime, ctime, exists
# - file info - mimetype, size, (thumbnail)
# - file access - read, write, touch, remove (clear)
# - folder access - list, touch, remove, file, folder, child
# - tree operations - move, copy
# - signal changes (internal) - specifically for version control
# - monitor changes (external) - specifically to pick up changes in open page

# OS dependent
# - pathname should support all variants, cross platform
# - path encoding for low level functions
# - atomic rename for writing

# Classes
# - FilePath - pathname manipulation
# - File - base class for files
# - Folder - base class for folders

# local file system:
# - LocalFSObjectBase - file / folder info
# - LocalFile - file info + file access + tree operations
# - LocalFolder - folder access + tree operation

# helpers:
# - FolderMask - wraps a Folder and exposes part of children, disables all but list()
# - FSObjectMonitor - monitor single file or folder for external changes
#	- ObjectMonitorFallback - at least report internal changes
# - FSTreeMonitor - monitor internal changes, passes itself as "logger" to children


# Key is that we always use objects to signal file vs folder,
# get rid of all uses of "isdir" because it shows a constructor issue.
# Instead use "folder.child(path)" to get either file or folder.
# Also no common FS object, just construct the parent folder first
#
# When instatiating you need to use specific LocalFolder or LocalFile
# this will alert you to the non-mockable nature of the code
#
# This also means that folder provide access to children, not parents
# if a object needs access to larger file system, a root folder
# should be passed as a requirement to the constructor; else you can
# not mock the function for testing.

# TODO
# - test on FAT file system - e.g. USB stick ?

# TODO - put in helper modules:
# - trash - optional, only support for local file - separate gui object
# - monitor with gio - separate gui object
# - thumbnailer - separate gui object

# TODO - don't do
# - lock for fs operations --> checkin / checkout mechanism in notebook, use notebook lock

# With respect to page interface:
# Page.source is used for:
# - StubLinker - export with links to real source
# - cusomt tools to get commandline arg
# - edit source command
# - versioncontrol & zeitgeist logger plugins
#   --> these are also only one interested in FS signals
# --> very limitted access needed

# Re checkin//checkout --> only needed for interface editing page
# implement by setting callbacks that can be called by the notebook
# before any operation.
# notebook.checkout(page, callback)
# notebook.checkin(page)
# notebook.update_checked_pages()
#   called automatically by most methods, call explicitly from export
#
# by calling all callbacks *before* any action we allow for error dialogs
# etc before modification - no surprises once running
# --> Make it a context manager lock to block checkout during operation etc.
