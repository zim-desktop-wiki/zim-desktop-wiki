This is the development documentation of zim.

B{NOTE:} There is also some generic development documentation in the
"HACKING" folder in the source distribution. Please also have a look
at that if you want to help with zim development.

In this API documentation many of the methods with names starting with
C{do_} and C{on_} are not documented. The reason is that these are
signal handlers that are not part of the external API. They act upon
a signal but should never be called directly by other objects.


Overview
========

The script C{zim.py} is a thin wrapper around the C{main()} function
defined in L{zim.main}. This main function constructs a C{Command}
object that implements a specific commandline command. The C{Command}
object then either connects to a running instance of zim, or executes
the application.

To execute the application, the command typically constructs a
C{Notebook} object, a C{PluginManager} and a C{ConfigManager}. Then
depending on the command the graphical interface is constructed, a
webserver is started or some other action is executed on the notebook.


The C{Notebook} object is found in L{zim.notebook} and implements the
API for accessing and storing pages, attachments and other data in
the notebook folder.

The notebook works together with an C{Index} object which keeps a
SQLite database of all the pages to speed up notebook access and allows
to e.g. show a list of pages in the side pane of the user interface.

Another aspect of the notebook is the parsing of the wiki text in the
pages such that it can be shown in the interface or exported to another
format. See L{zim.formats} for implementations of different parsers.

All classes related to configuration are located in L{zim.config}.
The C{ConfigManager} handles looking up config files and provides them
for all components.

Plugins are defined as sub-modules of L{zim.plugins}. The
C{PluginManager} manages the plugins that are loaded and objects that
can be extended by plugins.

The graphical user interface is implemented in the L{zim.gui} module
and it's sub-modules. The webinterface is implemented in L{zim.www}.

Functionality for exporting content is implemented in L{zim.exporter}.
And search functionality can be found in L{zim.search}.


Many classes in zim have signals which allow other objects to connect
to a listen for specific events. This allows for an event driven chain
of control, which is mainly used in the graphical interface, but is
also used elsewhere. If you are not familiar with event driven programs
please refer to a Gtk manual.


Infrastructure classes
----------------------

All functions and objects to interact with the file system can be
found in L{zim.fs}.

For executing external applications see L{zim.applications} or
L{zim.gui.applications}.

Some generic base classes and functions can be found in L{zim.utils}
