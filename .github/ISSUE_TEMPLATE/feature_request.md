When you want to pitch an idea:
- Consider going to the "discussions" forum first to discuss your idea; file it here only if it is fully detailed and ready for implementation
- Please provide a use case description; explain the problem you are trying to solve before describing the solution. This allows other users to think along and maybe improve on your solution.
- Make sure the use case is generic enough that it will benefit other users as well. If it is highly tailored for your specific work-flow, chances are that no-one will work on it (and no-one will want to maintain it in working state over the years).
