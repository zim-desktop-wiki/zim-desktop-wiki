  <description>
    <p>
      Zim brings the power of a wiki to your desktop, providing a neat and structured
      way to take notes and record your thoughts.
      Each page in Zim is automatically saved as text file with wiki markup,
      including the ability to link pages and to add other files as attachments.
      Pages in Zim are also displayed in the sidebar in a hierarchical tree style
      layout to help organize your notes better.

		Various plugins provide additional functionality, like a task list manager,
		an equation editor, a tray icon, and support for version control.

		<li>Take notes during meetings or lectures</li>
