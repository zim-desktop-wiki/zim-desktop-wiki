====== Working with Git ======

The zim code is kept under version control using the git version control system. See the website for documentation on using this system: https://git-scm.com/

The quick course, to get a copy of the zim code from a fork username/zim-desktop-wiki on github:

	git clone git@github.com:username/zim-desktop-wiki.git

Then you can create a branch:

	git checkout -b branch-name

To check in some changes (don't forget to give some meaningful changelog):

	git add
	git commit

After that you can make a pull request on github or create a patch that can be mailed:

	git format-patch HEAD~..HEAD
