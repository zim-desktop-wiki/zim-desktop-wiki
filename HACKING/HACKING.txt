====== HACKING ======

This notebook contains random notes and thoughts that may be useful when you want to change source code for zim.

It is not a complete tutorial or something like that for working with the zim object API. In fact all real API documentation can be found directly in the python modules. Anyway, the code is always the most up to date documentation for development.

When you are working with the development code check the folder "./tools/" for some useful scripts.


In addition we use the following resources to communicate on zim development:

Code repository:
https://github.com/jaap-karssenberg/zim-desktop-wiki

Bug tracker:
https://github.com/jaap-karssenberg/zim-desktop-wiki/issues (and many requests are on the old page https://bugs.launchpad.net/zim)
Also for feature requests

Development wiki:

Has e.g. the planning for some of the developers
